UT CS changes:
=============

There were some mistakes in makefile which were throwing errors while creating index.
Replaced makefile with build_index.sh

Use it as follows:

sh build_index.sh

This script does not remove/overwrite if index/idfile_mapping are already present.
So, remove them if indexing needs to be re run for some reason.

Use the build_index.sh script in the same way as 'makefile' was used in the old 
indexing setup. (Follow OLD README contents below. Just replace makefilw with build_index.sh.

This directory contains the makefile to index the TAC 2013 corpora.

For creating the index:

1. Make sure the $TAC_ROOT variable is set correcly, as described in the 
   top-level README.

2. Create a directory that will contain the index. Copy the makefile in that
   directory. E.g.:

   mkdir /path/to/2013index

3. Edit the makefile so that the corpuspath variable points to where the TAC
   corpus is stored in your directory structure. E.g.

   corpuspath=/path/to/LDC2013E45_TAC_2013_KBP_Source_Corpus_disc_2

4. Run the indexing by

   make isindexcomplete

5. For running a TAC run with that index, change the system.config accordingly: 

   index /path/to/2013index/index
   idfile_mapping /path/to/2013index/idfile_mapping
